Here are a few things you can do using Markdown.

## Headers

Headers let you create titles in different sizes. To do this, you just need to add the **# symbol plus a blank space to the beginning of your header**. The size of your header will depend on the number of # symbols you have added, 1 being the biggest and getting smaller the more you add.


*For example, this:*

(# On your mark,)  
(## Get set,)  
(### Go!)

*... would turn into this:*

# On your mark,
## Get set,
### Go!
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Text formatting

Just like you would in any text editor software, you can edit text using Markdown, only not by clicking a button.

For instance...

+ One asterisk (*) imediately before and after your text will make it *italic*

*like this*

+ But two asterisks (**) immediately before and after your text will make it **bold** 

**like this**

+ Two of these (~~) immediately before and after your text will ~~cross it out~~

~~like this~~ 
+ Adding two equal symbols (==) immediately before and after your text will ==highlight it==. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Want to combine them? Go ahead and do something like this

***~~Hell  yeah!~~***
... or maybe not all of them together... ***like so***<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Lists

There are two types of lists you can add: **ordered** and **unordered** ones.

**Ordered** lists are the ones that contain numbers and are great for indicating, for example, a series of steps.  

To create them, you just need to add a number at a dot (.) at the beginning of your line, like this:

1. First, buy your Kitkat.
2. Second, unwrap it.
3. Finally, enjoy it.

**NOTE:**
The numbers don't need to be in successive order or even start from 1 for the list to show them correctly.
<br></br>
**Unordered** lists are just *bulletpoints* and you make them by adding an asterisk (*), a plus symbol (+) or a dash (-) and a space at the beginning of your line, like this:

+ Hello
- Bonjour
* Guten tag<p>&nbsp;</p>
